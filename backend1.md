# 1. Backend Interview Question:

### 1.0.1. Build a RESTful API with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to manage a user database, incorporating the following features:

**1. API Endpoints:**

- `GET /users`: Retrieve a list of all users.
- `GET /users/:id`: Retrieve the details of a specific user by ID.
- `POST /users`: Create a new user, ensuring robust validation of user input.
- `PUT /users/:id`: Update an existing user's information, again with thorough validation.
- `DELETE /users/:id`: Delete a user by ID.

**2. MongoDB Integration:**

- Establish a connection to a MongoDB database.
- Define a Mongoose schema for User model, enforcing data integrity and consistency.
- Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Mongoose methods.

**3. Error Handling:**

- Implement graceful error handling for database errors, invalid user input, and potential server-side issues.
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes and informative error messages.

**4. Input Validation:**

- Validate user input for all endpoints, ensuring data integrity and security.
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.

**5. Code Organization:**

- Structure the code with clear separation of concerns, modularity, and readability.
- Adhere to established Node.js and MongoDB best practices.

**Additional Considerations:**

- _Authentication and Authorization_: Discuss strategies to secure the API and protect user data.
- _Testing_: Demonstrate an understanding of testing techniques for Node.js APIs.
- _Deployment_: Briefly address deployment considerations for Node.js applications.

**By evaluating this comprehensive question, interviewers can effectively assess the candidate's proficiency in essential Node.js and MongoDB skills, paralleling the scope of the frontend equivalent.**
