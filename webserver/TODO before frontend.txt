1. to send credential to backend, include : credentials true in front end 
2. then cors error will happen. 
3. fix: In server use a middleware to set res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Credentials",true)
4. use this before cors middleware

problem 2 (same-site error on cookies)
1. add sameSite:none, then secure:true while setting cookies
2. while deleteing add all options too expect for maxage
