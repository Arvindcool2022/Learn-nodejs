## Docker Interview Question: Building and Deploying a Dockerized Node.js Application

This question aims to assess a candidate's understanding of Docker concepts and their ability to apply them in a Node.js development workflow.

**Scenario:**

You've developed a simple Node.js application with an Express server that serves a static website. The application relies on external dependencies like a Node.js package manager (e.g., npm or yarn). 

**Task:**

1. **Dockerfile Creation:** Create a Dockerfile that:
    - Defines a base image suitable for running Node.js applications (e.g., `node:lts-alpine`).
    - Copies the application code from the current directory to the container.
    - Installs necessary dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
    - Exposes the appropriate port (e.g., port 3000) where the Express server listens.
    - Runs the server by executing the main application script (e.g., `node index.js`).

2. **Image Building:** Build a Docker image based on the created Dockerfile.

3. **Container Running:** Run the built Docker image as a container.

4. **Volume Mounting (Optional):** Explain the concept of volume mounting and its benefits for persisting application data outside the container. Demonstrate how to mount a volume for a specific directory within the container to store application data or logs.

5. **Port Mapping:** Briefly explain the purpose of port mapping and how it allows communication between the container and the host machine. Show how to map the exposed port from the container to a specific port on the host for accessing the application.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- Understanding of Dockerfile syntax and structure.
- Ability to define appropriate base images and commands.
- Knowledge of dependency management within Docker containers.
- Awareness of volume mounting and port mapping concepts.
- Clear communication of Docker concepts and their role in development workflows.

**Bonus Points:**

- Explain multi-stage builds and their advantages for creating smaller and more efficient Docker images.
- Showcase Docker commands for managing images and containers (e.g., `docker ps`, `docker logs`, `docker stop`).
- Discuss best practices for Dockerizing Node.js applications in production environments.

This question effectively evaluates a candidate's grasp of Docker fundamentals and their practical application in building and deploying Node.js applications using Docker containers.
